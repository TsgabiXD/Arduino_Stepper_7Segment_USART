# Arduino_Stepper_7Segment_USART
A relatively simple C Programm for Arduino and serial monitor.
The USART and Wait files are by another user and teacher of mine.
It is an example project for the clean coding with C on a µC,
while the Arduino IDE leaves some questions on what´s happening in the background.
